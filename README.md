# Cyber_Final

We are creating an intentionally vulnerable website. Users will download a virtual machine containing the website. They then must hack into the website through one of two methods (sql injections or hyrda). Inside they find a vigenere cipher, which leads them to a hidden directory containing an image. They download that image, use steganography to find the hidden link, and follow it to the message. We will leave hints along the way as for what to do. We are also considering adding a hacking tool that we haven't learned in class.
